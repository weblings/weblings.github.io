For Part A I made a finite state machine that determines which textures are used for the mountain, grass, and flatlands. What would have been simple code for the CPU forced me into this finite state machine structure for it work on the CPU. I also found very cool results can happen when the displacement of the heightmap is reversed.

For Part B I took the words "natural phenomenon" as my inspiration and set about to emulate sneezing. I put a plane with a noise texture in the background for some flair and an html button so that the user can sneeze at will.
