        <p>I’m currently working on a project that is using pixel art and I want to use a simple shader technique of raycasting from the camera’s perspective to see what color should be applied over a varying sized grid and passed to the screen. I’m curious to see what techniques produce the best results ranging from: raycasting form the center of the grid, a random point, averaging multiple. Extending on this concept I think it would be cool to apply outlines or lighting effects onto a render buffer of the result.
